# aponica/goosemgr-php

Abstract interface to a relational or object database.

A "Goose Manager" provides a consistent way to access an object or
relational database. 

This is never used directly, but serves as the base class for
[aponica/goosemgr-mysqlgoose-php](https://aponica.com/docs/goosemgr-mysqlgoose-php/)
(to connect to a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database using
[aponica/mysqlgoose-php](https://aponica.com/docs/mysqlgoose-php/)).

An equivalent JS package, 
[@aponica/goosemgr-js](https://aponica.com/docs/goosemgr-js), 
is maintained for consistency.

## Contributing

Please [contact us](https://aponica.com/contact/) if you believe this package
is missing important functionality that you'd like to provide.

Under the covers, the code is **heavily commented** and uses a form of
[Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) 
for data type guidance. If you submit a pull request, please try to maintain
the (admittedly unusual) coding style, which is the product of many decades
of programming experience.
